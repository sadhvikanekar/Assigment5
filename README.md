This project was created using Create React App, it’s a tool from Facebook that sets up everything you need to start building a React app without any hassle.

What You Can Do
In this project folder, you’ve got some handy commands to run and test the app.

npm start
This kicks off the app in development mode. Just open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see it live. The cool part? When you make changes in the code, the page reloads automatically so you can see what you updated right away. If there are any errors, you’ll see those in the console too.

npm test
Use this to start the test runner. It keeps watching your files and runs the tests interactively as you work. If you want to know more about testing with Create React App, they have good docs on it.

npm run build
When you’re ready to make your app go live, this command builds the project for production. It puts everything in a build folder, optimizing the JavaScript and CSS so it runs fast. The files get minified and have unique names so browsers won’t mess with caching. After building, your app is ready to be deployed anywhere!

npm run eject
Heads up, this one’s permanent. If you ever feel limited by the default setup and want full control over the build tools and configs like webpack or Babel, you can “eject.” This copies all the config files into your project so you can customize stuff. But be careful, because once you eject, there’s no going back, and you’ll have to handle all the build stuff yourself. Most projects don’t need this, so only use it if you really have to.
